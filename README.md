# java-sliders
I created this Java program in my Java Programming II course at ACC. This program allows the user to modify the RGBA values of an image. It also displays the color values of the original and modified images in a histogram format. The Framework01.java, Framework01Intfc.java, and Colors01.java files were created by my professor, Richard Baldwin. The task of the assignment was to create a new file, Proj12.java, that would display sliders that would allow the user to change the RGBA values of the image, using Colors01.java as a guide. Additionally, the Proj12.java file would provide the color value histograms of the original and modified images.
